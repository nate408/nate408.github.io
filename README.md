# The Orange Box
###### The Official Lore of Boxman


## The Begginning

  It all started at the beginning of the universe, when Boxman created a magical fruit. This fruit was the orange. Boxman loved oranges. Boxman loved oranges so much he made more. Then he made even more. Then, can you guess what he made next? More oranges. After about 19 oranges Boxman decided to make the entire universe. After exploring the universe in his orange powered *Boxmobile* he discovered Earth. He loved humans, and they impressed Boxman so much that he introduced them to oranges. Unfortunatley for them, they didn't really like oranges. In fact, the humans hated oranges. This angered Boxman so much that he destroyed the world. After **Boxman Destroyed The World** he rebuilt it with better humans. Humans that liked oranges. This world was better. to Boxman's dismay, not all the people liekd oranges. Most of them did, so he was ok with it for now. Boxman got lonley watching humans do random ass shit, so he decided to put his all mighty hand into the ocean and grab the first thing he saw. That thing was a shark. This shark was a dissapointment in Boxmans eyes. This shark had commited a horrible sin, for this shark did not particularlly enjoy oranges. Boxman looked upon this shark with shame and fixed it. It made this shark **LOVE** oranges, and gave it some arms and legs. Boxman then named his new pet with a beatiful name, **Shark With Arms and Legs*.
